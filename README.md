## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This platform is designed to be extensible for multiple tutorial topics:

- **Modular Tutorial System** - Easy to add new tutorials and learning phases
- **Reusable UI Components** - Consistent design system across all tutorials
- **Interactive Parameter Controls** - Flexible slider and input systems
- **Responsive Visualizations** - Charts that adapt to different data types and ranges

## üìö Current Tutorial: Black-Scholes Mathematics

### Core Formula
The Black-Scholes tutorial is built around the fundamental option pricing formula:

```
V = e^(-rT) ùîº^Q[Œ¶(S_T)]
```

Where:
- **V** = Option price
- **e^(-rT)** = Discount factor
- **ùîº^Q** = Risk-neutral expectation
- **Œ¶(S_T)** = Payoff function at expiration
- **r** = Risk-free rate
- **T** = Time to maturity

### Stock Price Evolution
Under the risk-neutral measure, stock prices follow Geometric Brownian Motion:

```
dS_t = rS_t dt + œÉS_t dW_t^Q
```

With solution:
```
S_T = S_0 e^((r - ¬ΩœÉ¬≤)T + œÉW_T^Q)
```

## üé® UI Components

The application uses a comprehensive design system built on:
- **shadcn/ui** components for consistent styling
- **Radix UI** primitives for accessibility
- **Custom color palette** with light/dark mode support
- **Responsive design** optimized for desktop learning

## üìä Learning Approach

This platform emphasizes:

- **Visual Learning** - Complex concepts explained through interactive charts and animations
- **Progressive Complexity** - Concepts build upon each other in logical sequence
- **Immediate Feedback** - Real-time updates as parameters change
- **Mathematical Rigor** - Proper notation and theoretical foundations
- **Practical Application** - Real-world relevance and applications

### Black-Scholes Tutorial Outcomes
After completing the Black-Scholes tutorial, users will understand:

1. **Risk-neutral pricing fundamentals** and why it's used in derivatives pricing
2. **Time's dual role** in option pricing (discounting vs. uncertainty)
3. **Probability distributions** and how they evolve with time
4. **Volatility's impact** on option values and the convex relationship
5. **Mathematical integration** in the context of expectation calculations

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Tutorials
To add new tutorials, create a new component following the existing pattern:

```javascript
const tutorials = [
  {
    id: 'black-scholes',
    title: 'Black-Scholes Option Pricing',
    component: BlackScholesApp
  },
